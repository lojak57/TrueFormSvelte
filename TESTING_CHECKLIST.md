# TrueForm Comprehensive Testing Checklist

This checklist identifies potential breaking scenarios and edge cases based on the codebase analysis. Each section includes specific test cases and potential failure modes.

## 1. Stripe Payment Integration ðŸš¨ (Currently Disabled)

**Status**: Stripe integration is commented out pending implementation. The service currently throws "not integrated yet" errors.

### When Enabled, Test These Scenarios:

#### Payment Link Generation (`/api/proposals/[id]/payment-link`)

- [ ] **Empty/Invalid Proposal Data**

  - Missing line items
  - Line items stored as string instead of JSON
  - Zero or negative prices
  - Missing company/contact information
  - Null/undefined values in critical fields

- [ ] **Edge Cases**

  - Very large amounts (> $999,999)
  - Very small amounts (< $1.00)
  - Tax rate of 0% or > 100%
  - Multiple installment plans with odd divisions
  - Non-USD currency attempts

- [ ] **Stripe API Failures**
  - Invalid API keys
  - Network timeouts
  - Rate limiting
  - Stripe service downtime
  - Invalid session creation parameters

#### Webhook Processing (`/api/stripe-webhook`)

- [ ] **Security Vulnerabilities**

  - Missing signature header
  - Invalid webhook signature
  - Replay attacks (old timestamps)
  - Malformed event data

- [ ] **Race Conditions**
  - Multiple webhooks for same payment
  - Webhook arrives before database is ready
  - Concurrent updates to proposal status

## 2. PDF Generation System

### Simple PDF Generator (`/lib/services/pdf/simplePdfGenerator.ts`)

- [ ] **Data Validation Issues**

  - Missing required fields (proposal, company, contact)
  - Malformed date strings causing `Invalid Date`
  - Special characters in company names breaking filename generation
  - XSS attempts in text fields (HTML injection)
  - Unicode characters in content

- [ ] **Line Item Edge Cases**

  - Empty line items array
  - Line items with missing prices/quantities
  - Very long item names/descriptions (> 1000 chars)
  - Decimal precision issues (e.g., 0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3)
  - Negative quantities or prices

- [ ] **Performance Issues**
  - Proposals with 100+ line items
  - Very large description texts
  - Memory issues with concurrent PDF generation

### Enhanced PDF Generator (Template-based)

- [ ] **Template Processing**
  - Missing template variables causing undefined errors
  - Circular references in template data
  - QR code generation failures
  - Logo URL failures (404, invalid format)

## 3. File Upload Handling

**Note**: No direct file upload implementation found. System appears to rely on external URLs only.

### Potential Risk Areas When Implemented:

- [ ] File size limits
- [ ] File type validation
- [ ] Malicious file uploads
- [ ] Storage quota exceeded
- [ ] Concurrent upload conflicts

## 4. Form Submission Flows

### Login Form (`/routes/login/+page.svelte`)

- [ ] **Input Validation**

  - SQL injection attempts in email/password
  - XSS in form fields
  - Very long inputs (> 1000 chars)
  - Unicode/emoji in passwords
  - Leading/trailing spaces in email

- [ ] **Authentication Edge Cases**
  - Rapid login attempts (brute force)
  - Session handling during redirect
  - Cookie setting failures
  - Cross-domain authentication issues
  - Browser autofill edge cases

### Wizard Submission (`/api/wizard-submissions`)

- [ ] **Data Integrity**

  - Missing required fields
  - Malformed wizard data structure
  - Company name conflicts (duplicate detection)
  - Very long text in description fields
  - Special characters in business names

- [ ] **Race Conditions**
  - Double submission (rapid clicks)
  - Company creation conflicts
  - Concurrent wizard sessions

### Proposal Creation Wizard

- [ ] **Multi-step State Management**
  - Browser back/forward navigation
  - Page refresh mid-wizard
  - Session timeout during wizard
  - Network disconnection and reconnection
  - Validation state inconsistencies

## 5. Database Field Length Limits

### Critical Fields Without Explicit Limits (TEXT type):

- [ ] **Company Table**

  - `name` - Test with 10,000+ character names
  - `website` - Test with very long URLs (2048+ chars)
  - `notes` - Test with 100KB+ text
  - `billing_street/city/state` - Test with long addresses

- [ ]alformed<Contact Table\*\*

  - `first_name/last_name` - Test 1000+ character names
  - `email` - Test maximum RFC-compliant email length (320 chars)
  - `phone` - Test international formats, extensions
  - `title` - Test very long job titles

- [ ] **Proposal Table**
  - `title` - Test 5000+ character titles
  - `line_items` (JSONB) - Test deeply nested/large JSON
  - `notes` - Test with formatted text, special characters

## 6. Error Handling Patterns

### Missing Error Boundaries

- [ ] **Component-level Errors**

  - No React/Svelte error boundaries found
  - Unhandled promise rejections in components
  - Network request failures not caught
  - JSON parsing errors not handled

- [ ] **API Error Responses**
  - Inconsistent error formats between endpoints
  - Missing error details for debugging
  - No request ID tracking for support

### Error Transformation Issues

- [ ] **Supabase Errors**
  - Generic "Invalid login credentials" may hide specific issues
  - Network errors masked as auth errors
  - Row-level security errors not properly communicated

## 7. Race Conditions & Async Issues

### Identified Risk Areas:

- [ ] **Dashboard Data Loading**

  - Multiple `Promise.all` without error isolation
  - No loading state coordination
  - Potential for partial data display

- [ ] **Wizard State Updates**

  - Rapid navigation between steps
  - Concurrent API calls during submission
  - State updates during async operations

- [ ] **Authentication Flows**
  - Login redirect race with cookie setting
  - Multiple auth checks in parallel
  - Session refresh during operations

## 8. Wizard Flow Edge Cases

### Conversational Wizard

- [ ] **Navigation Issues**

  - Skip steps using URL manipulation
  - Direct access to later steps
  - Browser history manipulation
  - Multiple wizard instances in tabs

- [ ] **Data Validation**

  - Addon pricing calculations with floating point
  - Total estimate overflow (> MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)
  - Missing required fields in submission
  - Timezone issues with timestamps

- [ ] **State Persistence**
  - Page refresh loses all progress
  - No draft saving mechanism
  - Network failure during final submission
  - Partial data submission on error

### Proposal Wizard

- [ ] **Service Selection**

  - Duplicate service additions
  - Custom item price validation
  - Quantity limits (0, negative, very large)
  - Service template modifications

- [ ] **Tax Calculations**
  - Rounding errors in tax amounts
  - Tax rate changes mid-wizard
  - Multiple tax jurisdictions
  - Tax-exempt scenarios

## 9. Security Vulnerabilities

### Identified Risks:

- [ ] **No CSRF Protection**

  - Forms vulnerable to cross-site attacks
  - API endpoints accept any origin

- [ ] **Input Sanitization**

  - XSS in proposal titles/descriptions
  - SQL injection in search queries
  - Path traversal in file operations

- [ ] **Authentication**
  - JWT/session expiration handling
  - Privilege escalation paths
  - Insecure direct object references

## 10. Performance & Scalability

### Load Testing Scenarios:

- [ ] **Concurrent Users**

  - 100+ simultaneous PDF generations
  - 1000+ active wizard sessions
  - Dashboard with 10,000+ records

- [ ] **Data Volume**
  - Companies with 1000+ proposals
  - Proposals with 500+ line items
  - Search across 100,000+ contacts

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Immediate Priorities**:

   - Implement error boundaries for all major components
   - Add input validation and sanitization
   - Fix race conditions in authentication flow
   - Add field length constraints in database

2. **Before Stripe Integration**:

   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Add webhook signature verification
   - Create payment reconciliation system
   - Add idempotency keys for transactions

3. **Monitoring Requirements**:

   - Error tracking (Sentry or similar)
   - Performance monitoring
   - API request logging with correlation IDs
   - User session recording for debugging

4. **Automated Testing**:
   - Add integration tests for all API endpoints
   - Create E2E tests for critical user flows
   - Implement visual regression testing
   - Add load testing for scalability

This checklist should be reviewed and updated regularly as the codebase evolves.
