- Minor naming inconsistencies between some modules

### Recommendations

1. **Clean up legacy files** after verifying migration completeness
2. **Standardize naming conventions** across all modules
3. **Document architectural patterns** for team consistency

### Exceptional Progress

- **61% of components** now comply with 200-line guideline (100/163 components)
- **Massive size reductions** achieved through systematic decomposition
- **Dead code elimination** (ProjectListLegacy.svelte - 732 lines removed)
- **Reusable component creation** enabling better code organization

### Component Size Improvements

| Component            | Before    | After     | Reduction |
| -------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Business Demo Page   | 610 lines | 84 lines  | 86%       |
| ContactCard          | 499 lines | 18 lines  | 96%       |
